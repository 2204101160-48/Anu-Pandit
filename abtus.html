        <h1>Why should you recycle e-waste</h1>
E-waste largely contains plastic, precious metals and toxic chemicals. Disposing e-waste responsibly helps to recycle plastic, extract metals for reuse, and treat toxic chemicals, such as lead, in a safe facility.


Recycling e-waste ensures that dangerous elements are treated properly and resources are conserved.


In India, over 90% of e-waste ends up in landfills or the informal sector where it is burnt or melted with acid. When e-waste is burnt or dumped in landfills, it releases harmful chemicals, such as cadmium, which adversely impacts human health and surrounding lands. As our planet has limited resources, it is essential for us to conserve natural elements through recycling and reuse. Hence, e-waste needs to be managed in a safe environment by experts.

    <h1>What happens to all the e-waste you discard?</h1>
The e-waste collected at Croma stores is transported to a central location which is then picked up by JustDispose for recycling. The e-waste is segregated, dismantled and recycled in a scientific manner at a


well-equipped facility owned by JustDispose. JustDispose is a government-authorised recycling partner and operates as per guidelines set by Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB).


Plastic and metals are extracted for recycling, and the hazardous materials such as lead, mercury and cadmium are shipped to government-run Common Hazardous Waste Treatment (CHWT) facility for safe and environment-friendly disposal. Croma and JustDispose ensure that the e-waste is managed responsibly.
