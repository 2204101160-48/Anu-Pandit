        <h1>Impacts on the environment and our health</h1>

Now, let's delve into the environmental and health impacts of E-waste. Although modern electronic devices have reduced the use of hazardous substances, the informal E-waste recycling sector in many developing countries use dangerous chemicals such as aqua regia, nitric acid, and hydrochloric acid to dissolve metals like gold and other precious materials found in E-waste.
<br><br>
Unfortunately, these hazardous chemicals are frequently mishandled and improperly disposed of. It is resulting in significant environmental and health risks. Without responsible E-waste management, particularly in regions with substantial informal recycling activities, there is an elevated risk of these substances contaminating the environment, including soil and water sources.In such informal sector, Women and children, in particular, are vulnerable, with documented effects on hormone levels and immune function due to exposure to toxic environments.
<br><br>
Moreover, improper E-waste management results in substantial greenhouse gas emissions when these items are disposed of, contributing to climate change. For instance, it's been reported that 98 million metric tons of CO2 equivalents were released into the atmosphere due to improper disposal of items like fridges and air conditioners in 2019 alone.
<br><br>
 This is equivalent to approximately 0.3% of global greenhouse gas emissions that year, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA). Furthermore, despite the recyclability of E-waste materials, when they're discarded, primary raw materials are extracted anew, exacerbating greenhouse gas emissions associated with mining and refining.z
